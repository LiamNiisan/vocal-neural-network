# vocal-neural-network

The goal of this project is to create a neural network from scratch. No machine learning framework is used, only `numpy` is used to handle the parameters of the model.

The built neural network is then used to learn vocal patterns and predict spoken numbers.

### Runtime
#### Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pyqt

#### Parameters

The parameters can be changed using the interface once the program is executed.

The parameters are written in the `nn_config.txt` file.

#### Execution

Run the `interface.py` file to start the program.

#### Log

At each epoch, the state of the model will be saved in `data/`
